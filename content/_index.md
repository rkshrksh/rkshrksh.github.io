Hi, I'm **Rakesh**.

I'm an **Azure Integration Specialist** and Technical Lead.

I build scalable, event-driven architectures that bridge the gap between legacy systems and the modern cloud. With 8+ years of experience across Azure and .NET, I specialize in transforming complex integrations into resilient, cost-efficient solutions while leveraging **Generative AI, LLMs, and agentic tools (like Copilot and OpenCode)** to accelerate delivery.
